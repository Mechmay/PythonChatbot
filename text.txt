The term frequency (i.e., tf) for phone is then (5 / 100) = 0.05. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word phone appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-IDF weight is the product of these quantities: 0.05 * 4 = 0.20
